## ðŸŸ¢ 1. Variables and Data Types

// var, let, and const are used to declare variables

var name = "Dnyaneshwari";  // function scoped
let age = 21;               // block scoped, let is safer and prevents bugs caused by variable leakage, best way to declare variable

// var is function-scoped and can lead to bugs
var count = 5;
var count = 10; // No error, but may cause confusion

// âœ… Better:
let age = 21;
// let age = 22;   // Error: Cannot redeclare



const country = "India";    // cannot be changed

// Data Types: 
Primptive : boolean, number, string, undefined, null , symbol, Bigint
non-primitive : object, array, function

// primptive = stack (data of primptive type is store in stack)
//nonprimtive = heap (data of non primtive type is store in heap)
// heap = dynamic memory allocation (whatever we change in heap will be reflected in the original data)
// stack = static memory allocation (whatever we change in stack will not be reflected in the original data)(It displays copy of the data whatever it is changed)
