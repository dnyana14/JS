// we adding a condition to control the flow of the program
// Control Flow refers to the order in which the instructions or statements in a program are executed.

// By default, a program runs from top to bottom, line by line.
// But with control flow statements, we can change that order â€” to repeat, skip, or choose different instructions based on conditions.
// Control flow statements allow us to control the execution of code based on certain conditions or loops.


//Types of Control Flow Statements:
// 1. Conditional Statements
// Used to make decisions based on conditions.
// if, else if, else

// 2. Looping Statements
// Used to repeat code.
// for, while, do...while, for-each

// jump Statements
// Used to change the flow suddenly.

// break, continue, return

const ischeck = true;
if(2 == "2"){               // here we cant access data type
    console.log("Executed");
}

// <, >, <=, >=, ==, ===, !=, !== are comparison operators which are used to the control the flow of the program
