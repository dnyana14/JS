//while = check first, then run, condition check first & then code will exwcute,  when you dont know how many times you want to repeat something, here condition check before loop start
//do...while = "run first, then check"
//A for loop is used when you know how many times you want to repeat something. here condition check before loop start
//for...in loop Used to get keys (indexes or property names) from objects or arrays.
//for...of loop Used to get values from arrays, strings, maps, sets, etc.
//forEach doesnâ€™t work on objects, only on arrays.

//note : first initilization is declared in the part of variable declaration and then increment is done in the body of the do loop
// do while loop is used when we want to execute the code at least once even if the condition is false
// in while loop the condition is checked first and then the code is executed, if the condition is false then the code will not be executed
